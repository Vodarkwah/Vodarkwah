- 👋 Hello, I’m Victor Darkwah-Owusu, a graduate student in petroleum engineering with a passion for coding and learning new skills.
- 👀 My goal is to become a cybersecurity researcher, data scientist, or software developer who can solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.
- 🌱 I have a background in software engineering from Holberton School (ALX SWE program), which I left due to the heavy workload as a result of my research commitments.
- I love coding so much that I commit to some of my private repositories every day, honing my skills and exploring new ideas.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with others.
- 📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vodark22), or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-darkwah-owusu-294734177/)
